# GIS Implementation in Quarry Operations
Based on industry webinar insights

## Current Industry Pain Points

1. Data Collection & Integration
- Fragmented data across systems
- Communication gaps between site and corporate
- Difficulty in highwall monitoring & safety
- Disconnected blast and mill performance
- Complex multi-year planning needs

2. Best Practices for Implementation

### Technical Standards
- Flight height: 50-100 feet for blast analysis
- Image overlap: 70-80% required
- Ground sampling distance: < 2cm/pixel
- Ground control points: Full site coverage
- Regular flight path replication

### Data Collection Requirements
- Geological mapping integration
- Post-blast performance monitoring
- Real-time highwall inspection
- Mine-to-mill performance tracking
- Standardized reporting methods

## Case Study: Pennsylvania Quarry Success
- $75,000+ savings in 6 months achieved through:
  1. Reduced drilling costs while maintaining production
  2. Record-breaking crusher throughput
  3. Reduced oversize material
  4. Enhanced logistics and shot planning
  5. Improved accuracy in quality assurance

## Planning Horizons

### Short-Range (<1 year)
- Daily data collection and tracking
- D&B data and production tonnage
- Overburden quantity management
- Equipment resource forecasting
- Stripping/rock availability balance

### Future Planning
- Mid-range planning (1-3 years)
- Long-range vision (3+ years)
